# Mastermind-game

In the file you will find a simulation of the game Mastermind and an A star search of the solution with a given heuristic (DFS with backtracking).
First you can play a game of Mastermind against the computer, in which you will be the codemaker, and the computer will be the codebreaker and try to break your code in 10 or less moves. Detailed instructions on the game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)
In the second part you can see how the algorithm traverses through the tree and looks for the solution with a heuristic explained in the comments in the file.
